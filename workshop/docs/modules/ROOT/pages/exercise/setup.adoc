= Workshop Environment

You can run this workshop in your own GPU environment or in a {productname-short} project and workbench.  


NOTE:  If you choose to run in your own environment with, you can skip the following steps and proceed to the next section.

== Setting up your data science project

To implement a data science workflow, you must create a data science project (as described in the following procedure). Projects allow you and your team to organize and collaborate on resources within separated namespaces.


.Procedure

** *Navigating to the {productname-short} dashboard*:
+
.. After you log in to the OpenShift console, click the application launcher icon on the header.

.. When prompted, log in to the {productname-short} dashboard by using your OpenShift credentials. {productname-short} uses the same credentials as OpenShift for the dashboard, notebooks, and all other components.
+

The {productname-short} dashboard shows the *Home* page.

. On the navigation menu, select *Data science projects*. This page lists any existing projects that you have access to. From this page, you can select an existing project (if any) or create a new one.

. Click *Create*.


== Creating a workbench

A workbench is an instance of your development and experimentation environment. When you create a workbench, you select a workbench image (sometimes referred to as a notebook image) that is optimized with the tools and libraries that you need for developing models. 


. Click the *Workbenches* tab, and then click the *Create workbench* button.

+
{org-name} provides several supported workbench images. In the *Notebook image* section, you can choose one of the default images or a custom image that an administrator has set up for you. The *Standard Data Science* image has the libraries needed for this {deliverable}.

. Select the latest *Standard Data Science* image.

. For Deployment size, choose the *Small* container size and *1* accelerator of the appropriate type.  
+
This will be sufficient for the TinyLlama model, but you can increase the size if you want to test larger models.

+
Your JupyterLab environment window opens.
+
This file-browser window shows the files and folders that are saved inside your own personal space in {productname-short}.

. Bring the content of this {deliverable} inside your JupyterLab environment:

.. On the toolbar, click the *Git Clone* icon:
